This userscript adds various features and options like:
 * Gallery
 * Filters
 * Reverse image search
 * Flag preview
 * Mascots
 * Notifications
 * Relative post dates
 * Post and image counts in the menu
 * Many other poorly written hacks

TvchX contains modifications designed to improve compatibility with NPFchan. 
There are also at the time of this writing two (poorly-implemented) features that weren't in the original 8chanX:
  * Animate .gif thumbnails
  * Off-site favorites
 

This is a userscript, you will need an addon to run it properly
