Fork of 8chanX that adds features to tvch.

To install: https://github.com/dunkvol4/TvchX/raw/main/Tvch-x.user.js

This userscript adds various features and options like:
 * Gallery
 * Filters (Complete with stub-hiding)
 * Reverse image search
 * Flag preview
 * Mascots
 * Notifications
 * Relative post dates
 * Post and image counts in the menu
 * Many other poorly written hacks

TvchX contains slight modifications designed to improve compatibility with NPFchan, but still mostly works with Infinity sites as well. Though TvchX's main purpose is to improve tvch, it's been successfully tested on smuglo.li, wizchan, and 8kun. By default TvchX is configured to work with tvch and smuglo.li.

There are also at the time of this writing two (poorly-implemented) features that weren't in the original 8chanX:
  * Animate .gif thumbnails
  * Off-site favorites
 

This is a userscript, you will need an addon to run it properly

HOW TO USE:
1. Click [Options] in the top right corner of the site.
2. Click TvchX in the dialogue that pops up.
3. Enable and disable TvchX features to your heart's content.

TvchX also modifies some of the settings in General upon installation. So if you dislike drag and drop file selection or image hover, you can go into General and disable it.
